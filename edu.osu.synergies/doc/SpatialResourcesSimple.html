				<P><h3>Model I of the Synergies project demonstration models</h3>
<p>The purpose of this model is to explore the interation effects of learners and learning resources across space.
The closer you are to a resource, the more likely you are to engage with it. The more you know a resource the more likely you are to engage with it in the future.
How might these basic assumptions effect the distribution of learning interest across a diverse community?</p>

					<h2>Parameters</h2>
						
		
				<H5>Learner Count  (int, default: 100)</H5>
				<i>The number of learners to create.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Learning Resource Count  (int, default: 10)</H5>
				<i>The number of learning resources to create.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Initial Interest Minimum  (double, default: 0.05)</H5>
				<i>The minimum level of interest that a learner will have at the beginning of the model. Initial interest is distributed uniformally between the minimum and maximum value.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Initial Interest Maximum  (double, default: 0.35)</H5>
				<i>The maximum level of interest that a learner will have at the beginning of the model. Initial interest is distributed uniformally between the minimum and maximum value.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Resource Efficacy Minimum  (double, default: 0.02)</H5>
				<i>The minimum efficacy that a given resource will make for learner interest in a given encounter. Efficacy is constant for a resource and affects all learners in the same way. It is distributed uniformally between the minimum and maximum value.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Resource Efficacy Maximum  (double, default: 0.09)</H5>
				<i>The maximum efficacy that a given resource will make for learner interest in a given encounter. Efficacy is constant for a resource and affects all learners in the same way. It is distributed uniformally between the minimum and maximum value.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Home Count  (int, default: 150)</H5>
				<i>The number of homes to create.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Time Segment  (int, default: )</H5>
				<i>The current time segment in the day. This could represent a slice of time, such as 15 minutes or an hour as defined by Time Segments in Day and is a value between 0 (inclusive) and Time Segments in Day (exclusive).</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Time Segments in Day  (int, default: 96)</H5>
				<i>The number of time segments in the day. The default value is 96, representing time slices of 15 minute increments [24 * (60 / 15) = 96].</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Time Segments Wandering  (int, default: 24)</H5>
				<i>The time a learner spends "wandering", that is not engaged in activities at home. (In this intentionally simplified model, school locations are not represented.) The default value is 24, representing 6 hours (24 / (60 / 15) = 6).</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Wandering  (boolean, default: )</H5>
				<i>Are the learners currently wandering? In this model, all learners wanred at the same time, representing for example time after normal school hours.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Next Learner ID  (int, default: )</H5>
				<i>(Supports unique IDs for learners.)</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Next Resource ID  (int, default: )</H5>
				<i>(Supports unique IDs for resources.)</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Next Home ID  (int, default: )</H5>
				<i>(Supports unique IDs for homes.)</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Subsequent Engagement Factor   (double, default: .05)</H5>
				<i>The increasing effect that each subsequent encounter with a learning resource will have on learner interest. This represents the notion that as learners become more familiar with a learning resource the learner is able to get more out of that resource. For example, once a learner knows how to find the books she's interested in at the library, the easier it will be for her to discover books that she might be interested in.</i><BR/>
		
				<H5>Lot Count  (int, default: )</H5>
				<i>The number of lots to create.</i><BR/>
