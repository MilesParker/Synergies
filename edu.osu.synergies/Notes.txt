building a model for the community w/ is a reflection of what community thinks as weel as having a solid grounding in terms of solution planning theory.


Renninger: Psychological but missing access physical context. GIS is important.
Rogoffian: 

Process. In late fall build a model that reflects social community model.
Two very simple models:
1. Show what an ABM model can do.
2. Illustrate 
a) threshold
b) feedback
3. Vehicle for introducing social science work.

Ideas:
1) Start with the Physical:
Emergence of interest from interaction of resources. Located in specific fixed places. Closer you are the more likely to engage. Setting where we learn science.
Reinforcing feedback. The more frequent, the next time.
Variability along interest.
External resources.
2) Social space:
Threshold effect. Up to a certain point, guidance agents effect interest, but after that point that falls off. Guides should have variability. Some will enhance interest and some will not. 
Bi-Modal Distribution. 
Tally of number of kids who have exceeded threshold effect. More interest -> Darker Green.
